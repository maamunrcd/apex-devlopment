					<h4>THE STARTING POINT OF ALL ACHIVEMENT IS DESIRE</h4>
					<p>apex-engineering has completed more than 20 installations in Bangladesh. 
						Our customers are some of the world’s largest and most recognized companies. 
						Our innovative solutions are specific to meeting water purification and reuse requirements of major industries, 
						including upstream oil and gas, unconventional oil gas, petrochemical, power generation, and mining.
						<br />
						<br />
						The power generation industry is one of the greatest consumers of water worldwide, making water and <b>wastewater treatment</b> a vital topic. At Aquatech, we have extensive experience and solid track record with coal, gas fired, and biomass power plants. We offer our customers complete industrial treatment solutions and technologies to meet purity, recycling, and discharge guidelines.
						<br />
						<br />
						<b>Ensuring Compliance</b>
In 2015, the United States EPA issued both final Coal Combustion Rules (CCR’s) and revised Effluent Limitation Guidelines (ELG’s). Both of these regulations impact the water balance of power plants throughout North America. One of the primary challenges to coal-fired power plants is to meet new discharge requirements for Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) purge streams.
<br />
<br />
Treating FGD wastewater requires the removal of emission contaminants including selenium, mercury, arsenic and nitrate, which can be challenging. A compliant solution for coal fired power plants is Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD), a proven process which totally eliminates FGD wastewater discharge through the recovery of clean water for reuse, and converting suspended solids and emission content into dry solids suitable for disposable. Aquatech has vast, unparalleled experience with FGD wastewater, having designed, installed, and operated a number of proven ZLD systems at coal-fired power plants throughout the world.
